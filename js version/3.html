<h1>Career Goals</h1><p>In 2024, one year from now I plan to be learning in college about computers, and  to have a related job. In order to achieve this, I will maintain my good grades, graduate high school, apply to colleges, apply for scholarships, and stay determined. In 2028, five years from now, my college education will be complete, and I will start a full time job at a company related to my degree. To achieve this, I will work hard now, graduate college, and apply for jobs. In 2038, ten years from now, I plan on being in a higher up area in the company. I ended up working for. To achieve this, I will show that I can do good work, earn more certifications, learn more, and network with people in the company.
