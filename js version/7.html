<h1>Community Service</h1><p>			<h3><b>Safe Net Ministries - Stafford</h3><p class='centernews'> 86 Main St, Stafford Springs, CT 06076 - (860) 851-9987</b><br>I have helped Safe Net several times throughout the years. My first time working with them was during Boy Scouts, where I assisted in a food drive by delivering bags, which request people to deposit food, to houses across Stafford. A week later, I assisted in picking them up and sorting through the food collected. I removed any food that went bad or had expired, and sorted the foods by type. I have worked here after that first food drive by assisting with more food drives and by distributing the food to those in need of it.</p><br><h3><b>Stafford Elementary School</h3><p class='centernews'>11 Levinthal Run, Stafford Springs, CT 06076 - (860) 684-6677</b><br>Being in my town's the Boy Scout troop, I ended up assisting in a landscaping project for the local elementary school. The school has a roundabout, for parents who are dropping of their kids, that had a large patch of grass in the center. With the troop and the cub scout packs in my town, I helped turn it into a garden.</p><br><h3><b>Stafford Historical Society</h3><p class='centernews'>5 Spring St, Stafford Springs, CT 06076 - (860) 684-7978</b><br>I am currently working on a website for the Stafford Historical Society. The website is still being worked on, so it's not public yet, but it is my most complex project I have ever worked on in the website realm. It features a database that will be full of a list, images, and data surrounding their many artifacts. It will have a account system where verified users can edit and add to the database. I started it as my Eagle project for Boy Scouts.</p><br><h3><b>First United Methodist Church of Stafford Springs</h3><p class='centernews'>8 Church St, Stafford Springs, CT 06076 - (860) 684-2468</b><br>I have been here many times- despite not being a member of the church or the Methodist religion. I have cleaned the yard of that place several times, I have helped set up for events and clean up after them, and I have worked in the soup kitchen there as well. </p><br>

The radio appears to have some non-original capacitors, so someone had already worked on it before. The GE radio is from the early 50's and it uses vacuum tubes. </p>
